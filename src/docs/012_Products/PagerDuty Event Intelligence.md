The PagerDuty Event Intelligence package consists of a suite of tools: time-based alert grouping, intelligent alert grouping, similar incidents, threshold alerts, notes, and scheduled rules.  

##Alert Grouping
###Time-Based Alert Grouping

Time-Based Alert Grouping will automatically add incoming alerts into open incidents on a service to help keep you focused on the problem at hand. Once Time-Based Alert Grouping is enabled on a service, the first new incoming alert will create a new incident. Subsequent alerts will be added to that incident for the specified time period while the incident is open.

To learn more about this feature, check out our article on [Time-Based Alert Grouping](doc:time-based-alert-grouping).

###Intelligent Alert Grouping

Intelligent Alert Grouping allows your responders to stay focused during a storm of alerts. When enabled on a service, Intelligent Alert Grouping uses a machine-learning based algorithm to automatically group related incoming alerts into a single open incident. 

No rules or additional configuration is needed in order for this algorithm to start grouping alerts - it begins grouping automatically once enabled. Over time, the Intelligent Alert Grouping algorithm will readjust to the unique history of alerts on your service. It's a tool that gets smarter the more you use it.

Intelligent Alert Grouping weighs various factors to determine when to group alerts. This includes recurring patterns in how responders have acknowledged, resolved, and grouped incidents in the past, as well as alerts previously grouped via the Time-Based Alert Grouping feature.

##Similar Incidents
Getting notified of an issue can be stressful – especially if the incident appears unfamiliar or new. For responders, seeing previous similar incidents adds helpful context for an accurate triage that leads to shorter resolution time. You can see whether you or someone on your team was involved in a similar incident, when these types of incidents happen, and dive into any of these incidents to discover what remediation steps were taken in the past.

##Threshold Alerts
With Threshold Alerts, it is possible to receive PagerDuty notifications only when your customized alert conditions breach specified limits. In this way, responders effectively reduce alert noise without missing critical issues.

##Adding Notes
Notes can help responders resolve incidents faster by including information or links related to the system that the event comes from. Notes are added automatically using Global Event Rules.

##Scheduled Event Rules
You can gain a greater degree of control over your event rules by detailing a single specific time in the future in which they will be active. This is particularly helpful during rules testing and planned maintenance.

##Recurring Event Rules
If there are specific hours of the day or day(s) within a week when you would like an event to follow a particular rule, you can set its activity on an automatic, weekly recurring schedule. This feature is specific to each individual event rule and you can make additional changes, such as changing severity/priority, based on time of day.

##Disable Event Rules
If you would like to pause an event rule’s activity, you can disable and re-enable it at a later time. This feature allows you to manually initiate integration-specific disablement during maintenance or testing on a tool.
