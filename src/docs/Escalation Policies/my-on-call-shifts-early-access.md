My On-Call Shifts allows users to view their shifts across all escalation policies and schedules in a single, easy-to-use view. This feature displays if a user is on call now, a list of their associated shifts and what their schedule is for the upcoming weeks and months. Users can now easily create override shifts across multiple schedules because all of the shifts are accessible in one place. My On-Call Shifts is also available as a widget on the right side of the Incidents page, displaying their current shift, and when they are on call next.
