title: "Account Ownership"
excerpt: ""
---
Every PagerDuty account has one user that is designated as the Account Owner. This user has access to perform any actions in the account, and is the only user with access to Account Settings, which includes details such as the account's pricing plan, user limits, billing and payment information (including invoices), SSO configuration, and the ability to change the account owner.

If you are an Account Owner and want to promote another user to be your account's owner, go to **Configuration** :fa-arrow-right: **Account Settings** and then click the **Account Settings** tab. In the **Change Account Owner** section, begin typing this user's name, select them from the list and click **Change account owner**.

If your current account owner has left your organization and their PagerDuty login information is not available, you can [contact our support team](mailto:support@pagerduty.com) for assistance with account ownership changes.
