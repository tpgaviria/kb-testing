Most times in the PagerDuty web UI are rendered in the desired time zone of the user currently logged in. There are some exceptions to this on the User, Team, and System reports in [Advanced Analytics](doc:analytics#section-advanced-analytics). When users are added, their personal time zones will match the [account-level time zone](/docs/time-zones#section-changing-the-account-level-time-zone) by default, and they can change their [user-level time zone](/docs/time-zones#section-changing-the-user-level-time-zone) if necessary. Itâ€™s important to note that a user profile can have a different default time zone than the account level time zone, and that all on-call schedules will be viewed in your selected time zone.
