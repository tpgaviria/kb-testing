#### [@pagerdutyhelp](https://twitter.com/pagerdutyhelp)

This account is how we reach out to resolve customer service issues that come to us through Twitter. If you receive a response concerning a PagerDuty issue you tweeted about earlier, it will come from here. Additionally, updates to outages will come from this account.
