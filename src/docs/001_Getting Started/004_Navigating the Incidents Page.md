## Incidents on All Teams Section

The top of the dashboard shows any triggered or acknowledged incidents currently active in the account. In the example below, there is currently 1 triggered incident and 1 acknowledged incident in PagerDuty. The left side will show triggered and acknowledged incidents specifically assigned to you and the right side will show a total of all triggered or acknowledged incidents in thePagerDuty account. If there is a triggered incident the text will be red, and if there is an acknowledged incident the text will be orange. If there are no open incidents, the text will remain black.
