Every PagerDuty account has one user that is designated as the Account Owner. This user has access to perform any actions in the account, and is the only user with access to Account Settings, which includes details such as the account's pricing plan, user limits, billing and payment information (including invoices), SSO configuration, and the ability to change the account owner.

If you are an Account Owner and want to promote another user to be your account's owner, go to **Configuration** :fa-arrow-right: **Account Settings** and then click the **Account Settings** tab. In the **Want to make someone else owner of this account** section, begin typing this user's name, select them from the list and click **Make this person the account owner**.
