# Maintenance Windows

---
Maintenance windows temporarily disable a service, including all of the integrations for the service, for a set period of time. A service disabled under a maintenance window is considered to be in maintenance mode.

No new incidents will be triggered while a service is in maintenance mode. Existing incidents will not resolve; they will remain open and continue to notify users on the expected escalation policy until manually resolved.

When a maintenance window ends the service will immediately exit maintenance mode and incidents can start triggering again.

> Admin, Manager, Global Admin or Account Owner roles can manage maintenance windows.

>If you're not sure what role you have, or if you need your permissions adjusted, visit our sections on [Checking Your User Role](https://support.pagerduty.com/v1/docs/user-roles#section-checking-your-user-role) or [Changing User Roles](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/user-roles#section-changing-user-roles).

## Recurring Maintenance Mode for Services

If you perform regularly scheduled maintenance that results in notifications being sent from your monitoring system to PagerDuty, you can use our API to create recurring maintenance windows in PagerDuty to prevent incidents from being triggered during these maintenance periods.

We've created a few different tools to help make this process easy for users who prefer a web UI, as well as those who would rather work in the command line:

* [Ruby 2.x Compatible Script (pd_maintenance_windows_v2.rb)](https://gist.github.com/lfepp/16a670d7a5e21afa5302401c2fe91653) (Note: You will need a v2 REST API key.) 
* [Python 2 Compatible Script](https://gist.github.com/lfepp/32afebc59aa4b88a733bcc1b4f7236f9) (Note: You will need a v2 REST API key.) 

Please note the Ruby scripts will not run as is, but require you to substitute your own values for the variables at the points indicated in the source code. Once the substitutions have been made, the script will allow you to create maintenance windows programmatically.

Other values as set in the script you may want to change also. For instance, the maintenance start and end time are 2 hours apart; please change this to adjust the length of time for the maintenance window. The script as written will also create 20 maintenance windows, separated from each other by a week's time; please adjust these values to either adjust the number of windows or the length of time between windows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will incidents created before the service is put in maintenance mode be automatically resolved?

No; existing open incidents will remain in their current state.

Moreover, incidents will not be automatically resolved through the Events API either. Maintenance mode is like flipping the "off" switch for all integrations; no actions can be taken through the Events API for all of that service's integrations when it is in a maintenance period, or disabled.
